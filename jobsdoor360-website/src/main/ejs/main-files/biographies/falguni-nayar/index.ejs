        <h1>The Story of Nykaa</h1>
        <h2>How Falguni Nayar Built India’s Beauty Empire</h2>
      
        <h3>💡 Spotting the Opportunity</h3>
        <p>
          In the early 2010s, Falguni Nayar noticed that India’s beauty and personal care market was highly fragmented. Customers struggled to find authentic international brands, and offline stores were limited to metros. Having worked in investment banking for decades, she saw a gap for a trusted online platform that could combine authentic products, advice, and convenience.
        </p>
      
        <h3>🚀 Founding Nykaa (2012)</h3>
        <p>
          In 2012, at the age of 49, Falguni left her high-profile career at Kotak Mahindra to start Nykaa with her personal savings (~₹2 crore). The company started as an online beauty marketplace, focusing on authenticity and premium brands, bootstrapping in the initial years before attracting angel investors.
        </p>
      
        <h3>🛠️ Early Growth & Private Labels</h3>
        <p>
          By 2015, Nykaa launched its own private labels and opened the first offline store, creating an omnichannel model. Her daughter Adwaita Nayar joined to scale offline retail, and brand partnerships with L’Oréal and MAC boosted trust.
        </p>
      
        <h3>📈 COVID-19 Boost & Market Leadership</h3>
        <p>
          In 2020, COVID-19 accelerated e-commerce adoption, making Nykaa a household name. The platform expanded to personal care, wellness, and fashion while building loyalty with women customers across India. Her son Anchit Nayar joined to lead the omnichannel and retail expansion.
        </p>
      
        <h3>🏦 Nykaa IPO & Billionaire Status</h3>
        <p>
            In 2021, Nykaa went public with a blockbuster IPO. Falguni Nayar became India’s richest self-made woman billionaire, with the family retaining majority control and the company achieving a multi-billion-dollar valuation.
        </p>
