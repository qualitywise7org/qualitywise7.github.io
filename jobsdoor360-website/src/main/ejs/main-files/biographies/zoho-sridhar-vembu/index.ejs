        <h1>The Story of Zoho</h1>
        <h2>How Sridhar Vembu Got the Idea</h2>
      
        <h3>üí° Spotting the Opportunity</h3>
        <p>
          In the mid-1990s, while working in the U.S. at Qualcomm, Sridhar Vembu and his brothers noticed that most enterprise software was expensive and designed for large corporations. Small and mid-sized businesses lacked affordable, reliable tools. They saw a gap and an opportunity to build software using skilled engineers in India for a global market.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üöÄ Founding AdventNet (1996)</h3>
        <p>
          In 1996, Sridhar, along with his brother Kumar and Tony Thomas, started <strong>AdventNet</strong> in Pleasanton, California. They began by building network management software (like SNMP tools) and bootstrapped the company using personal savings.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Bootstrap Culture & Early Success</h3>
        <p>
          AdventNet chose to remain independent and avoided outside funding. This allowed them to reinvest profits and stay focused on long-term goals. Their first big win came from enterprise clients using their network tools, which provided consistent revenue and validated their model.
        </p>
      
        <h3>‚òÅÔ∏è Pivot to Cloud SaaS</h3>
        <p>
          In the early 2000s, with the dot-com crash and changing tech trends, Sridhar shifted the company toward cloud-based software for businesses. They started building products like Zoho Writer and Zoho CRM. In 2009, they rebranded as <strong>Zoho Corporation</strong> to reflect this new direction.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üìõ Why ‚ÄúZoho‚Äù?</h3>
        <p>
          The name ‚ÄúZoho‚Äù was chosen for its simplicity ‚Äî and because the domain was available! It reflects the company‚Äôs practical and humble beginnings.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üå± Building from the Grassroots</h3>
        <p>
          Inspired by his rural roots, Sridhar later moved back to Tamil Nadu and began hiring and training young people from small towns through his <strong>Zoho Schools of Learning</strong>. This initiative helps students without formal college degrees develop valuable tech skills.
        </p>
      
        <blockquote>
          ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need a fancy degree to build world-class software. You just need curiosity, discipline, and an opportunity.‚Äù
        </blockquote>
      
        <h3>‚≠ê Summary</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Lack of affordable business software for SMEs</li>
          <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Build cloud software from India for global customers</li>
          <li><strong>Approach:</strong> Bootstrap, avoid VC, reinvest earnings</li>
          <li><strong>Outcome:</strong> A successful SaaS suite serving millions worldwide</li>
          <li><strong>Legacy:</strong> Rural innovation and grassroots education</li>
        </ul>
