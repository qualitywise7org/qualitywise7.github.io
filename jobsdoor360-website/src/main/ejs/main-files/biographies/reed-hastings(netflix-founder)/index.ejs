        <h1>The Story of Netflix</h1>
        <h2>How Reed Hastings Changed Entertainment</h2>
      
        <h3>üí° The Spark of an Idea</h3>
        <p>
            In 1997, Reed Hastings returned a rented movie late and was charged a $40 late fee.
            Frustrated, he imagined a subscription-based DVD rental service with no late fees.
            This small inconvenience sparked an idea that would disrupt the global entertainment industry.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üöÄ Founding Netflix (1997)</h3>
        <p>
            In 1997, Reed Hastings co-founded Netflix with Marc Randolph in California as a simple DVD-by-mail service. They began with just 30 employees and 925 movie titles, offering a subscription plan with no late fees‚Äîa concept that Blockbuster never anticipated. Despite the novelty of e-commerce at the time, the idea quickly attracted curious early adopters.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Early Challenges & Learning</h3>
        <p>
            The early years were filled with challenges and learning. Investors were skeptical, competition loomed, and profitability seemed distant. Reed even invested his own savings and took personal financial risks to keep the company afloat. Through this period, his wife‚Äôs encouragement and steady family support gave him the resilience to persist and push forward.
        </p>
      
        <h3>‚òÅÔ∏è Pivot to Streaming (2007)</h3>
        <p>
            By 2007, the digital era opened new doors, and Reed made the bold pivot to streaming, transforming Netflix from a DVD rental business into a tech-first entertainment company. This shift not only cut operational costs but also allowed Netflix to reach global audiences and change how people consumed movies and TV shows. Throughout this growth, Reed maintained a stable and private family life, even as his leadership faced mounting pressures.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üé¨ Original Content & Global Expansion (2013‚Äì2020)</h3>
        <p>
            From 2013 to 2020, Netflix entered its golden era of global expansion and original content. With iconic shows like House of Cards and Stranger Things, Netflix became a cultural phenomenon and a dominant player in entertainment. By the time COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 accelerated streaming demand, Netflix had expanded to over 190 countries, securing its place as the world‚Äôs top streaming platform.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üå± Vision & Legacy (2025)</h3>
        <p>
            By 2025, Reed Hastings stepped back from daily operations to focus on education and philanthropy, emphasizing purpose over wealth. His journey from a $40 late fee to a $200B+ global enterprise reflects innovation, adaptability, and the power of bold vision in transforming an industry.
