    <h1>Melanie Perkins Biography (Struggle in life year wise with financial condition)</h1>

    <div class="intro">
      <strong>Family Background:</strong><br>
      Melanie Perkins was born in <strong>1987</strong> in <strong>Perth, Western Australia</strong>, into a modest, middle-class multicultural family.
      Her father, an <strong>engineer of Malaysian‚ÄìFilipino heritage</strong>, instilled in her a sense of technical curiosity and problem-solving skills, while her mother, a <strong>teacher</strong> of Australian descent, nurtured creativity, discipline, and a love for learning.
      She grew up with siblings in a supportive household that valued education, hard work, and practical life skills.
      Although the family was comfortably middle class, they were not wealthy; vacations were simple, and entrepreneurship was not a family tradition.
      This upbringing, combined with her multicultural background, fostered a mindset of resourcefulness, humility, and curiosity‚Äîqualities that would later help her navigate the global entrepreneurial journey of building Canva.

        <h1>The Story of Canva</h1>
        <h2>How Melanie Perkins Got the Idea</h2>
      
        <h3>üí° Spotting the Opportunity</h3>
        <p>
            In the mid-2000s, while studying at the University of Western Australia, Melanie Perkins noticed that students struggled to learn complex graphic design tools like Adobe Photoshop and InDesign. Designing simple materials like posters or yearbooks was slow and intimidating for beginners. Melanie saw a gap: the world needed an easy-to-use, web-based design platform accessible to anyone, regardless of professional skills.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üöÄ Fusion Books ‚Äì The First Step (2007)</h3>
        <p>
          In 2007, Melanie Perkins, along with her then-boyfriend and now husband Cliff Obrecht, founded Fusion Books, an online platform that allowed students and schools to design and print their own yearbooks. Operating from her mother‚Äôs living room, the small startup quickly gained traction in Australia and eventually expanded to New Zealand and France. The experience of building Fusion Books taught Melanie the fundamentals of creating a simple, cloud-based collaborative design platform, which later became the foundation for Canva.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Bootstrap & Global Vision</h3>
        <p>
          For several years, Melanie tirelessly pitched her vision for a global design platform, facing more than 100 rejections from investors. She and Cliff bootstrapped their venture, surviving by reinvesting Fusion Books‚Äô modest profits. The breakthrough moment came when she met Bill Tai, a Silicon Valley investor, during a startup networking trip. His mentorship and connections eventually helped secure Canva‚Äôs first seed funding, turning their vision into reality.
        </p>
      
        <h3>‚òÅÔ∏è Founding Canva (2013)</h3>
        <p>
          In 2013, Melanie officially launched Canva with Cliff Obrecht and Cameron Adams, a former Google engineer. The platform revolutionized design by offering drag-and-drop simplicity with pre-made templates, making professional-quality design accessible to anyone. Canva‚Äôs freemium model, viral marketing, and ease of use fueled explosive growth, attracting millions of users worldwide.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üåé Global Growth & Unicorn Status (2018‚Äì2021)</h3>
        <p>
          By 2018‚Äì2021, Canva had expanded to over 190 countries, with more than 60 million users, and reached a peak valuation of $40 billion USD, becoming one of the world‚Äôs most successful tech unicorns. Remarkably, the company achieved profitability without heavy advertising, relying primarily on organic growth and global adoption.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üå± Vision and Impact</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout this journey, Melanie Perkins has remained committed to a mission-driven approach, emphasizing empowerment through simplicity.
