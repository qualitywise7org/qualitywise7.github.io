        <!-- <h2>How Sridhar Vembu Got the Idea</h2> -->
      
        <h3>üí° Spotting the Opportunity</h3>
        <p>
          In the late 2000s, India‚Äôs digital payments infrastructure was still underdeveloped. Cash dominated transactions, and online payments were cumbersome.

        <h3>üõ† Early Challenges & First Breakthrough</h3>

          The Indian market was not fully ready for digital wallets, and convincing users to trust online payments was a tough battle for Upasana Taku and her team. MobiKwik relied heavily on word-of-mouth growth and merchant onboarding, slowly building credibility in a cash-dominated economy. By 2013, the company achieved its first breakthrough when it began attracting small-scale angel investments, which helped sustain operations and expand services.
