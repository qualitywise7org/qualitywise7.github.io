      <h1>Swami Vivekananda's Speech</h1>
      <h2>Parliament of the World's Religions, Chicago – 1893</h2>

      <p><strong>"Sisters and Brothers of America,"</strong></p>

      <p>
        It fills my heart with joy unspeakable to rise in response to the warm and cordial welcome which you have given us.
        I thank you in the name of the most ancient order of monks in the world; I thank you in the name of the mother of religions;
        and I thank you in the name of millions and millions of Hindu people of all classes and sects.
      </p>

      <p>
        My thanks also to some of the speakers on this platform who, referring to the delegates from the Orient, have told you that
        these men from far-off nations may well claim the honor of bearing to different lands the idea of toleration. I am proud to
        belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal
        toleration but we accept all religions as true.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of
        the earth. I am proud to tell you that we have gathered in our bosom the purest remnant of the Israelites, who came to
        Southern India and took refuge with us in the very year in which their holy temple was shattered to pieces by Roman tyranny.
        I am proud to belong to the religion which has sheltered and is still fostering the remnant of the grand Zoroastrian nation.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “As the different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their water in the sea, so, O Lord,
        the different paths which men take through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight,
        all lead to Thee.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The present convention, which is one of the most august assemblies ever held, is in itself a vindication, a declaration to
        the world of the wonderful doctrine preached in the Gita:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Whosoever comes to Me, through whatsoever form, I reach him; all men are struggling through paths which in the end lead to me.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Sectarianism, bigotry, and its horrible descendant, fanaticism, have long possessed this beautiful earth. They have filled
        the earth with violence, drenched it often and often with human blood, destroyed civilization and sent whole nations to
        despair. Had it not been for these horrible demons, human society would be far more advanced than it is now.
      </p>

      <p>
        But their time is come; and I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honor of this convention may be the
        death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between
        persons wending their way to the same goal.
