        <h1>The Story of Nike</h1>
        <h2>How Sridhar Vembu Got the Idea</h2>
      
        <h3>üí° The Spark of an Idea (1962)</h3>
        <p>
            Fresh out of Stanford with an MBA, Phil Knight had a crazy idea: what if Japanese running shoes could compete with the dominant German brands in the U.S.? On a trip to Japan, he discovered Onitsuka Tiger shoes and saw an opportunity to revolutionize American sports footwear. This ‚ÄúCrazy Idea‚Äù became the seed for what would become Nike.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üöÄ Blue Ribbon Sports ‚Äì Humble Beginnings (1964)</h3>
        <p>
            Phil teamed up with his former track coach, Bill Bowerman, to sell imported Japanese shoes under the name Blue Ribbon Sports. They started small‚Äîselling shoes out of the trunk of Phil‚Äôs car at track meets. His parents‚Äô house became a storage room, and the family lived frugally to keep the business alive.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üõ†Ô∏è Becoming Nike (1971)</h3>
        <p>
            After years of distributing Onitsuka shoes, Phil and his team decided to design their own. They named the brand Nike, inspired by the Greek goddess of victory, and Carolyn Davidson designed the iconic Swoosh for $35. This bold move turned them from resellers into innovators.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üìà Going Public & Dominating Sports (1980)</h3>
        <p>
            Nike went public, transforming Phil from a scrappy entrepreneur into a multimillionaire. Athlete endorsements, innovative running shoes, and global expansion positioned Nike as a sportswear powerhouse. His family finally saw financial security after years of risk and sacrifice.
        </p>
      
        <h3>üåé Legacy & Philanthropy (2025)</h3>
        <p>
            Phil Knight stepped back from active management to focus on giving back. His donations to education and the arts have exceeded billions. From selling shoes out of a car to building a $45 billion empire, his story reflects persistence, calculated risk-taking, and the power of a bold idea.
